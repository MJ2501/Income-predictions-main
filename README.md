## Overview
In this project about the income prediction of the census data where it is been predicted that where a person earns more than $50k or less than $50k using.
At initall phase I have done the EDA of the raw data and convert it into the cleaned data. 
Then XGBoost Algorithm is used as the ML model for training the dataset for the prediction.
